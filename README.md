Synthetic Data with Synthpop

These R scripts relate to a series of simulation conditions for making synthetic data, using the Synthpop package in R. To obtain more information on the structure of the code, please download the "Overview.html" file in the repository, which talks about the structure of the code for each simulation condition. 

Additionally, the dataset used to make synthetic data in the manuscrpt was not available for public release. So for these demonstrations, a single synthetic dataset has been included (called "Dummy_Data.xlsx"), and can be used to run through the code and check for understanding each output.
